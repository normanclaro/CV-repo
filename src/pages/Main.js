                I consider myself a candidate with motivation, organization and ability to work
                under pressure. I have a clear and logical mind that allows me to solve
                problems and be able to complete tasks in the most convenient way. I enjoy
                work on my own initiative or as part of a work group, and I am reliable,
                Responsible and always work with the highest criteria. I also adapt to
                changes and I find motivation in every challenge.
            </p>
